@node Description
@chapter Description

@code{wol} broadcasts so called Magic Packet Frames across a network to wake up 
hardware, that understands such packets. These are normally NIC's with
Wake On Lan function.

@code{wol MAC-ADDRESS} assembles a Wake On Lan packet for hardware address
@code{MAC-ADDRESS}. The hardware address is written as x:x:x:x:x:x, where x is
a hexadeciml number between 0 and ff which represents on byte of the address,
which is in network byte order.



@node Options
@chapter Options

@itemize
@item
-i x.x.x.x, --ipaddr=x.x.x.x

Broadcast packet to this IP Address. This is important, if you want to send
a packet to another subnet, because not all routers routes packets addressed
to the default IP address 0.0.0.0.

@item
-p NUM, --port=NUM

Send packet with this destination port. This option is important, if a packet
filter would block the default destination port 40000.

@item
-f FILE, --file=FILE

Read hardware addresses, IP addresses and ports from file FILE.

@item
-v, --verbose

Turns on verbose output.

@item
-w NUM, --wait=NUM

Waits NUM milliseconds between magic packets. Also known as fuse health pack.

address 00:4F:49:07:0B:5F.


@item
wol -f /etc/ethers

Read hardware address and corresponding ip address from file /etc/ethers.

File looks like:
