- cleanup macfile.c -> it works, but I think it's ugly
- add passwd support in magic.c
- wol.gmo in hpux isn't here? bug in gettext?
- parse dhcpd.conf
- magic packets > 1 -> put several packets into one buffer for sending over the
	line
- ipv6? only for interest, cause there is no ipv6-only host out there, huh?
