This is wol, the Wake On Lan client. It wakes up magic packet compliant
machines such as boxes with wake on lan ethernet-cards.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

See the file ABOUT-NLS for National Language Support. If your system doesn't
provide nls support, configure wol with "./configure --with-included-gettext".
Use "./configure --disable-nls" if you don't want NLS support.
