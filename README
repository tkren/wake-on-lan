This is wol, the Wake On Lan client. It wakes up magic packet compliant
machines such as boxes with wake-on-lan ethernet-cards. Some workstations
provides SecureON which extends wake-on-lan with a password. This feature
is also provided by wol.

wol has a homepage at http://ahh.sourceforge.net/wol/
